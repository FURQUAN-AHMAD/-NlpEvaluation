1.Hello Sir,
Thankyou for giving me chance to solve this Assignment it was very challenging.
recently I have enrolled myself in the udacity course how self driving car operates there is lots of coding that Iam currently learning that is based on deepLearning concepts like Convolutional Neural Network
Computer vision using udacity self driving car simulator.

2.Formally, a vector space V' is a subspace of a vector space V if
V' is a vector space
every element of V′ is also an element of V.
Note that ordered pairs of real numbers (a,b) a,b∈R form a vector space V. Which of the following is a subspace of V?

ans.The set of pairs (a, b) for all real a ≥ b
